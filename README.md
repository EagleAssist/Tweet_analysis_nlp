# Tweet_analysis_nlp

Tweets Sentiment Analysis is a project that focuses on predicting the sentiment of tweets using natural language processing techniques. The project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to classify tweets into different sentiment categories. The model is trained on a dataset of tweets with corresponding sentiment labels.

## Model Architecture
The sentiment analysis model architecture includes an Embedding layer for word representation, an LSTM layer for sequence learning, and Dense layers for classification. The model is compiled with categorical crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer.
